# Ajak Majok's website

Activist and politician Ajak Majok was my first client!

I made version 1.0 of her website in a week with only HTML and CSS, back when I had only been learning coding for less than a month. You can find the old repository here: https://github.com/xurxe/Ajak-Majok

I made a new site with React, as well as a headless CMS with Contentful.
